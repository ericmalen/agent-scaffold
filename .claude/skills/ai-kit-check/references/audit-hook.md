# Optional: audit Stop-hook

An opt-in end-of-session nudge. When a Claude Code (or VS Code Copilot) session
ends, it runs the kit audit against this repo and prints one line if the
AI-config has drifted off the target state. It never blocks the session and is
silent when the repo is clean or no kit checkout is reachable.

This complements, and does not replace, the CI `audit-strict` gate
(`templates/ci/audit-strict.*.yml`): CI is the hard gate; the hook is an
in-session heads-up so you catch drift while you are still working.

## Wire it (opt-in)

Add to `.claude/settings.json` (read natively by both tools — R-46). The script
finds the kit via `$AI_KIT_HOME`, `.claude/ai-kit-adoption/` (during adoption),
or `~/tools/ai-kit`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "node .claude/skills/ai-kit-check/scripts/audit-nudge.mjs"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Remove the `hooks` block to turn it off. The `audit-nudge.mjs` script exits 0
in every case, so a missing kit or a parse error is silently ignored.
