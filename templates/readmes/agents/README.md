# Agents

Specialized roles both Claude Code and VS Code Copilot can delegate to. One
agent = one responsibility.

Conventions (enforced by `ai-kit-check`): kebab-case filenames; a one-line role
statement opening the body; `description` saying what the agent does and when
to delegate; an explicit `tools:` list (omitting it grants ALL tools); `##
Procedures` and `## Never` sections; `## Documents` listing plain
repo-root-relative paths (no Markdown links — agents lazy-load these).

To author a new agent, run the `agent-creator` skill. Run the `ai-kit-check`
skill to audit this folder against the full rule set.
